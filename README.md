This Power Bi dashboard was created for a grocery shop.
Given: 1. Calender Table; 2. Customers table; 3. Products Table; 4. Regions Table; Returns Table, and Transactions for 2 years.

To start with the data, all the tables were added using ETL- (Export, Transform, and Load)
All the tables were renamed and all the columns were checked for the data types to maintain the consistency.
Some columns were added as per the need of the dashboard.

All the tables were loaded to the model view and relationships were formed as per the facts and dimensions tables.
Date hierarchy was created in the model view.

Coming to the tabular view, all the colums like date and regions were categorised.
Other columns were added as per the requirement of the dashboard.

Then at last in the model view, 
1. KPI cards were added showing the major numbers to analyse the Total Transactions, Total profit, and Total returns at a broad level.
2. Different product brands were shown with respect to the Total Profit, Total Transactions, Profit rate, and return rate.
3. Total transactions were also shown by city and by the regions (with the help of tree maps and region hierarchy) to analyse the hot selling areas and low selling areas.
4. Weekly revenue was added as per the ask of client.
5. Revenue v/s target was added to show the actual numbers by expected numbers.
